# Homeseer-Tools
v 0.0 5/9/20 - Initial Issue

This repository is for various scripts and tools that I use with my HomeSeer setup.

Currently for use with HS3, but should work with HS4 unless otherwise noted.

# hs-banner.sh
This is a bash script to display an information banner on login. I have it added to my .bashrc to serve as a reminder that I have logged into my Production machine and take care with making changes.

# install-hs3.sh
This will "install" the homeseer.service into systemd.  Make sure that you have gone through and updated working directories as needed.
